    <p>
    Since August this year, my normal morning greeting has been: "Mone, nem blo me
JD an mifala waka fo Rural Wata Supply lo Gizo, Solomon Islands." (Hi, my name is
Jaidev and we work for the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation department from
Gizo, Solomon Islands.)</p><br><p>
As part of an AusAID volunteer program (Australian Youth Ambassadors for
Development - AYAD), I'm spending a year in the Solomon Islands working as a
water engineer. My role involves performing water surveys for remote island
communities for the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Service (part of the
Ministry of Health). The RWSS program (currently funded by AusAid) looks to
provide drinking water to the 300+ inhabited islands that form the Solomons. The
program is aimed at rural communities, which encompasses 85 per cent of the
total population, with the majority engaging in subsistence farming.</p><br>
<h3>About the RWSS</h3><p>
The main goal of the RWSS program is to reduce water-borne diseases that may
occur as a result of limited access to water and sanitation. The RWSS program’s
focus is not only on installation of infrastructure, but also a strong emphasis on
project sustainability to achieve better (and longer lasting) community outcomes.
By enabling the community to actually look after their own water supply, we can
avoid a situation where many systems break and remain unrepaired soon after
installation. The RWSS fosters community involvement through a variety of
methods, including education on system maintenance, sanitation and hygiene as
well as assistance with the establishment of community water committees to
oversee the installation, ownership and expansion of the system.</p><br><p>
As one of only three engineers working for the RWSS, there is plenty to keep me
busy! On a day-to-day basis, my role involves travelling to remote communities to
perform water source assessments. Most communities are located along the coast,
while water sources are usually located inland (either streams, rivers or springs).
After arranging to meet with the village chief or elder, we go for a bit of a bushwalk
to look for an appropriate water source. After considering yield, topography and
water quality I start logging a route on my GPS back from the source to the village.
At the village, we look at where to put taps, which way the village looks it will
expand, and if there are any erosion issues (we try to avoid these!). Back at the
office, I'll use this information to design and cost a simple gravity fed system to
accommodate the community’s needs. I've learnt very quickly that everything we
do is low-cost and proven technologies!</p><br>
<h3>Gizo Life</h3><p>
The Solomons is a beautiful place, and luckily I get to see a lot of the countryside
for work. People here are extremely friendly, and always keen to share and explain
their culture. I'm fortunate enough to live away from the bustle of the capital
(Honiara). I'm located in Gizo, the capital of the Western Province, which is about
300 km from Honiara. When I'm not working, I've taken up diving and snorkelling,
as well as my new favourite hobby: lounging on a hammock by the beach!</p><br><p>
