        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he Solomon Islands has experienced a tumultuous decade, with ethnic tensions escalating over a five-year period from 1998. With the support of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), hostilities ceased in 2003 and the country began the rebuilding process.<br><br>
        Today, essential services such as education, health and infrastructure, which were disrupted by the tensions, are slowly regaining momentum. Numerous challenges lay ahead, particularly for infrastructure projects such as water and sanitation. However the outlook is optimistic.<br><br>
        Solomon Islands is one of Australiaâ€™s closest neighbours and is comprised of nearly 900 picturesque islands. Eighty-five per cent of the almost 600,000 Solomon Island- ers live in rural areas, spread over 300 islands. The majority of the population engage in subsistence farming and fishing, and have little disposable income. Although many of these communities were geographically removed from the tensions, the effect was widespread disruption of government services.</p>

      <p>Although generally not as water-scarce as other countries, Solomon Islands is unlikely to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets for both water supply and sanitation. Presently, 75% of the population have access to an improved water supply compared to the MDG target of 85%. This shortfall can be attributed in part to the tensions (where rural development was disrupted) and to infrastructure damage from the 2007 earthquake and tsunami.

      <blockquote>"Sanitation coverage for the Solomons is poor. Less than a third of the population have access to adequate facilities, well below the regional average of 46% for Pacific Island countries."</blockquote>

      <p>The majority of water supply projects in the Solomons are gravity-fed systems, using rivers, creeks and springs as sources. The standard design is to construct a dam at the source connected to ferro-cement tanks located at the community using poly pipe. <br><br>
      The water is then distributed to communal standpipes. Although system sizes are small and the water sources are often less than 3km away, the cost of materials and shipping is quite high. <br><br>
      Other less commonly used systems include rainwater harvesting systems, hand-dug wells (where water is available and contamination is not an issue), and small-scale pumping sys- tems (eg solar). With the latter two systems, reliability and maintenance is a key factor to ensure that the system continues to work in years to come.</p>
